<p>Starting out as cobbled together one page node server, it grew over the past
year to a more featured server. Totally rewritten and refactored a couple of
times, it now can function as a https server, and a socket server as well.
Customized logging, caching in memory and disk, and on the fly transpiling,
minifying and compressing of assets and more have turned it into a more
production ready server. </p>
<p>At the same time it still starts up with a single word command, all the features
are then disabled by default. A lot of features can still be enabled on that
same command line, but for an easier and more complete configuration a config
file can be used. No plugin system, since it is easier to just write it into the
server than designing one, except for the transpilers, compressors etc, more can
easily be added by using little api.</p>
<p>Mostly a learning experience for me, however I do use it for some of my sites. </p>

<h3 id="-html-builder-https-github-com-michieljoris-html-builder-"><a href="https://github.com/Michieljoris/html-builder" target="_blank">html-builder</a></h3>
<p>A simple html build system using templates of sort. Using
<a href="https://github.com/flatiron/plates" target="_blank">flatiron plates</a> to fish out markers from
the html soup and a javascript object to knit it all together again. But again,
because I wrote it myself I can adapt it easily to whatever I need it to be, and
you learn a lot while writing and adapting it. 
<a href="https://github.com/Michieljoris/dbeditor" target="_blank">dbeditor</a></p>
<p>Dbeditor allows you to connect to your dropbox, browse the contents and then
edit text files using a markdown or wysiwyg editor.</p>

<h3 id="-cachejs-https-github-com-michieljoris-cachejs-"><a href="https://github.com/Michieljoris/cachejs" target="_blank">cachejs</a></h3>
<p>Implementation of both LRU and ARC cache. Used in bb-server. It includes a
heavily commented arc_cache.js file. The Adaptive Replacement Cache algorithm is
supposed be efficient. I think I understand how it works, but whether I could
have written it I don&#39;t know. It seems clever.</p>

<p>A word play on futon, the database manager that comes with CouchDB. I thought it
was not as useful as it could be, so I wrote my own version. It allows you to
edit the various design docs in the manager. It also simplifies editing and
enabling replications, and a number of other enhancements. As usual I start out
with big plans for an app, and implement the bulk of it, but there definitly
still things that could be worked on and expanded on. </p>
<p>The other half of this app is a wizard to make it very easy for people to
install and cors enable a CouchDB database for use with an other web app,
roster. It then initializes the database depending on who they are and what
their preferences are, setting up the right replications and permissions.</p>

<h3 id="-validate_doc_update-https-github-com-michieljoris-validate_doc_update-"><a href="https://github.com/Michieljoris/validate_doc_update" target="_blank">validate_doc_update</a></h3>
<p>Used for the roster web app to easily manage read -and- write permissions. I
didn&#39;t want to write a different validate_doc_update document for every use
case, so I made a generic one that can be controlled via a little dsl, embedded
in the read permissions. See the github repo for more info.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been doing shift work to make ends meet for a number of years. I got tired
of filling in time sheets, I never seemed to do that without at least one
mistake or correction, so I made a little Excel worksheet for my own use. This
time sheet was picked up by other staff and management and it had to be adapted
to other work places. In the end Excel worksheet just got to complicated so I
made this web app. </p>
<p>It is built using <a href="https://smartclient.com/" target="_blank">Smartclient</a> for the interface and
is served by CouchDB where the data is stored as a couchapp. At the moment it
sits on a Linode server. Users are authenticated and can be assigned roles. The
user database is synced between databases. I wrote a long spiel about the
security aspects of the app <a href="http://roster_help.axion5.net/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>The app can be run offline because it uses application cache. The app itself can
be synced to a local database, and so can the data the app runs against. The app
can also be run against an in-browser database using an implemention of a
browser version of CouchDB: <a href="http://pouchdb.com/" target="_blank">pouchdb</a>. </p>
<p>I tried to keep the UI as simple as possible, no menus, only 5 little
buttons. The user can build up their own UI to some extent by dragging and
dropping, this gets persisted accross sessions, and even accross databases. </p>
<p>The thing is designed really to be backend agnostic and extendable by plugin
views, even plugin types. But at the moment it works against CouchDB and has only
the following types (and their editors): shift, location, person, settings,
user and the following views of data: table, calendar and time sheet. The design
of the app is such that it is quite easy to add more views of the data, like a
graph for instance. </p>
<p>From the repo&#39;s README:</p>
<blockquote><p>To help people set up a CouchDB instance I wrote quilt, it configures and sets up all the necessary replications for them. It is also a generic CouchDB manager a la futon.</p>
<p>The idea is to have a decentralized but hierarchical group of CouchDB instances against which the app can work, see my blurb on security.</p>
<p>In the end staff can view their upcoming shifts online, bosses can manipulate them, and management can have an overview and collate all the data easily.</p>
<p>SmartClient is a bit cumbersome and it would be nice to rewrite the app using no
frameworks. Especially the calendar gets a bit sluggish.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>The app itself is used by a few people at the organisation I wrote it for. I had
a meeting/presentation with management, but things can move a bit slow at these
organizations. Or maybe I am just not the best salesman..</p>

<h3 id="-bootstrapjs-https-github-com-michieljoris-bootstrapjs-"><a href="https://github.com/Michieljoris/bootstrapjs" target="_blank">bootstrapjs</a></h3>
<p>To keep the roster app modular I wrote my version of requirejs. Not AMD
compatible, but same idea and functionality. See the repo for more info. I had
ideas of having it concatenate all the files in the right order for production
use. However browserify and the use of transpiled languages (clojure!) make it
all this a bit obsolete. Let alone that javascript itself will have modules in
es6 it seems. But it was fun to write, basically doing a depth first search to
resolve the dependencies, with detection of cyclic dependencies.</p>
